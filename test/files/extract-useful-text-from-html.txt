You&#8217;ve finally got your hands on the diverse collection of HTML documents you needed.  But the content you&#8217;re interested in is hidden amidst adverts, layout tables or formatting markup, and other various links.  Even worse, there&#8217;s visible text in the menus, headers and footers that you want to filter out.  If you don&#8217;t want to write a complex scraping program for each type of HTML file, there is a solution.
This article shows you how to write a relatively simple script to extract text paragraphs from large chunks of HTML code, without knowing its structure or the tags used.  It works on news articles and blogs pages with worthwhile text content, among others&#8230;
Do you want to find out how statistics and machine learning can save you time and effort 
mining text
?
The concept is rather simple: use information about the density of text vs. HTML code to work out if a line of text is worth outputting.  (This isn&#8217;t a novel idea, but it works!)  The basic process works as follows:
Parse the HTML code and keep track of the number of bytes processed.
Store the text output on a per-line, or per-paragraph basis.
Associate with each text line the number of bytes of HTML required to describe it.
Compute the text density of each line by calculating the ratio of text to bytes.
Then decide if the line is part of the content by using a neural network.
You can get pretty good results just by checking if the line&#8217;s density is above a fixed threshold (or the average), but the system makes fewer mistakes if you use machine learning &#8212; not to mention that it&#8217;s easier to implement!
Let&#8217;s take it from the top&#8230;
Converting the HTML to Text
What you need is the core of a text-mode browser, which is already setup to read files with HTML markup and display raw text.  By reusing existing code, you won&#8217;t have to spend too much time handling invalid XML documents, which are very common &#8212; as you&#8217;ll realise quickly.
As a quick example, we&#8217;ll be using 
Python
 along with a few built-in modules: 
htmllib
 for the parsing and 
formatter
 for outputting formatted text.  This is what the top-level function looks like:
def
 extract_text
&#40;
html
&#41;
:
    
# Derive from formatter.AbstractWriter to store paragraphs.

    writer = LineWriter
&#40;
&#41;
# Default formatter sends commands to our writer.
formatter
 = AbstractFormatter
&#40;
writer
&#41;
# Derive from htmllib.HTMLParser to track parsed bytes.
parser
 = TrackingParser
&#40;
writer, 
formatter
&#41;
# Give the parser the raw HTML data.
parser
.
feed
&#40;
html
&#41;
parser
.
close
&#40;
&#41;
# Filter the paragraphs stored and output them.
return
 writer.
output
&#40;
&#41;
The TrackingParser itself overrides the callback functions for parsing start and end tags, as they are given the current parse index in the buffer. You don&#8217;t have access to that normally, unless you start diving into frames in the call stack &#8212; which isn&#8217;t the best approach!  Here&#8217;s what the class looks like:
class
 TrackingParser
&#40;
htmllib
.
HTMLParser
&#41;
:
    
&quot;&quot;
&quot;Try to keep accurate pointer of parsing location.&quot;
&quot;&quot;
def
__init__
&#40;
self
, writer, *args
&#41;

&#40;

&#41;

def
 parse_starttag
&#40;
self
, i
&#41;
:
        index = 
htmllib
.
HTMLParser
.
parse_starttag
&#40;
self
, i
&#41;

.
writer
.
index
 = index
        
return
 index
    
def
 parse_endtag
&#40;
self
, i
&#41;
:
        
self
.
writer
.
index
 = i
        
return
htmllib
.
HTMLParser
.
parse_endtag
&#40;
self
, i
&#41;
The 
LineWriter
 class does the bulk of the work when called by the default formatter.  If you have any improvements or changes to make, most likely they&#8217;ll go here.  This is where we&#8217;ll put our machine learning code in later.  But you can keep the implementation rather simple and still get good results.  Here&#8217;s the simplest possible code:
class

This code doesn&#8217;t do any outputting yet, it just gathers the data.  We now have a bunch of paragraphs in an array, we know their length, and we know roughly how many bytes of HTML were necessary to create them.  Let&#8217;s see what emerge from our statistics.
Examining the Data
Luckily, there are some patterns in the data.   In the raw output below, you&#8217;ll notice there are definite spikes in the number of HTML bytes required to encode lines of text, notably around the title, both sidebars, headers and footers.
While the number of HTML bytes spikes in places, it remains below average for quite a few lines.  On these lines, the text output is rather high.  Calculating the 
density
 of text to HTML bytes gives us a better understanding of this relationship.
The patterns are more obvious in this density value, so it gives us something concrete to work with.
Filtering the Lines
The simplest way we can filter lines now is by comparing the density to a fixed threshold, such as 50% or the 
average
 density.  Finishing the 
LineWriter
 class:
def
 compute_density
&#40;
self
&#41;
:
        
&quot;&quot;
&quot;Calculate the density for each line, and the average.&quot;
&quot;&quot;

        total = 
0.0
for
 l 
in
self
.
lines

            l.

 =

&#40;

&#41;

&#40;

&#41;

            total += l.
density
# Store for optional use by the neural network.
self
.
average
 = total / 
float
&#40;
len
&#40;
self
.
lines
&#41;
&#41;

&nbsp;
    
def
 output
&#40;
self
&#41;
:
        
&quot;&quot;
&quot;Return a string with the useless lines filtered out.&quot;
&quot;&quot;
self
.
compute_density
&#40;
&#41;

        output = 
StringIO
.
StringIO
&#40;
&#41;
for
 l 
in
self
.
lines
:
            
# Check density against threshold.
# Custom filter extensions go here.
if
 l.

 &amp;gt; 
0.5
:
	        output.
write
&#40;
l.

&#41;
return

getvalue
&#40;
&#41;
This rough filter typically gets most of the lines right.  All the headers, footers and sidebars text is usually stripped as long as it&#8217;s not too long.  However, if there are long copyright notices, comments, or descriptions of other stories, then those are output too.  Also, if there are short lines around inline graphics or adverts within the text, these are not output.
To fix this, we need a more complex filtering heuristic.  But instead of spending days working out the logic manually, we&#8217;ll just grab loads of information about each line and use machine learning to find patterns for us.
Supervised Machine Learning
Here&#8217;s an example of an interface for tagging lines of text as content or not:
The idea of supervised learning is to provide examples for an algorithm to learn from.  In our case, we give it a set documents that were tagged by humans, so we know which line must be output and which line must be filtered out.  For this we&#8217;ll use a simple neural network known as the perceptron.  It takes floating point inputs and filters the information through weighted connections between &#8220;neurons&#8221; and outputs another floating point number.  Roughly speaking, the number of neurons and layers affects the ability to approximate functions precisely; we&#8217;ll use both single-layer perceptrons (SLP) and multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) for prototyping.
To get the neural network to learn, we need to gather some data.  This is where the earlier 
LineWriter.output()
 function comes in handy; it gives us a central point to process all the lines at once, and make a global decision which lines to output.  Starting with intuition and experimenting a bit, we discover that the following data is useful to decide how to filter a line:
Density of the 
current
 line.
Number of HTML bytes of the line.
Length of output text for this line.
These three values for the 
previous
 line,
&#8230; and the same for the 
next
 line.
For the implementation, we&#8217;ll be using Python to interface with 
FANN
, the 
Fast Artificial Neural Network
 Library.  The essence of the learning code goes like this:
from
 pyfann 
import
 fann, libfann
&nbsp;

# This creates a new single-layer perceptron with 1 output and 3 inputs.

obj = libfann.
fann_create_standard_array
&#40;
2
, 
&#40;
3
, 
1
&#41;
&#41;

ann = fann.
fann_class
&#40;
obj
&#41;

&nbsp;

# Load the data we described above.

patterns = fann.
read_train_from_file
&#40;
'training.txt'
&#41;

ann.
train_on_data
&#40;
patterns, 
1000
, 
1
, 
0.0
&#41;

&nbsp;

# Then test it with different data.
for
 datin, datout 
in
 validation_data:
    result = ann.
run
&#40;
datin
&#41;
print
'Got:'
, result, 
' Expected:'
, datout
Trying out different data and different network structures is a rather mechanical process.  Don&#8217;t have too many neurons or you may train too well for the set of documents you have (overfitting), and conversely try to have enough to solve the problem well.  Here are the results, varying the number of lines used (1L-3L) and the number of attributes per line (1A-3A):
The interesting thing to note is that 0.5 is already a pretty good guess at a fixed threshold (see first set of columns).  The learning algorithm cannot find much better solution for comparing the density alone (1 Attribute in the second column).  With 3 Attributes, the next SLP does better overall, though it gets more false negatives.  Using multiple lines also increases the performance of the single layer perceptron (fourth set of columns).  And finally, using a more complex neural network structure works best overall &#8212; making 80% less errors in filtering the lines.
Note that you can tweak how the error is calculated if you want to punish false positives more than false negatives.
Conclusion
Extracting text from arbitrary HTML files doesn&#8217;t necessarily require scraping the file with custom code.  You can use statistics to get pretty amazing results, and machine learning to get even better.  By tweaking the threshold, you can avoid the worst false positive that pollute your text output.  But it&#8217;s not so bad in practice; where the neural network makes mistakes, even humans have trouble classifying those lines as &#8220;content&#8221; or not.
Now all you have to figure out is what to do with that clean text content!

10 Responses to &#8220;The Easy Way to Extract Useful Text from Arbitrary HTML&#8221;

For the simple greedy immidietly local threshold, we could introduce a few assumptions to find a perhaps better estimate than the average. The average of some set is frequently used because it is the point with the least square distance over all values in the set. In this case however, there are two separate sets: text items and markup items.

If we assume that each follows a normal distribution (which is common) and there is some probability to pick from one of them, we may estimate these parameters and find the values Thete for which the probability of either classification is 0.5.

Solving this we receive the threshold:

theta* = ( m_y t_y - m_z t_z +- (m_y - m_z) sqrt(t_y t_z) ) / (t_y - t_z)

where m_y is the average of the text items, m_z the average of the markup items and t_z and t_y are given by:

t_y = s_y ln p

t_z = s_z ln(1-p)

where s_y is the estimated standard deviation, which is

sum of all i: (y_i - m_y)^2

and similar for z.

p is the ratio of text items, i.e. |y| / (|y| + |z|).
A LaTeX formula can be found here:
http://ai-freenode.wikidot.com/the-easy-way-to-extract-useful-text-from-arbitrary-html
I can add additional details if anyone wishes. Reservations for errors, did this hastily and it is not double checked in any way.
It should yield a bit better estimate than just the average but only relies on the immidietely local features and not for instance the relation to neighbors and global features. These should have a great impact. Hence, ANNs should work better if feasible.

 ), a simple data extraction service which can convert any webpage to structured information and generate a RSS feed for it. I use it daily for newsreading, mashups, and even for data integration at work. Its really awesome!

Great work. We actually use a HTML parser (BeautifulSoup) and then find then in each div (or any container) tag decide whether to include the text in the output or not based on the link to text ratio. We mostly need to remove the sidebar menus and top menus which mostly have anchor tags inside the container tags.

We also rule out some basic script/object/embed tags and also use common css classes to identify comments, header, etc.

Works pretty good for us, but would also like to try this out.
